1. When a character is moved from one zone to another, the "binding" to the onclick event seems to break.  Even if it is not updated.
    1.1 Could this be solved be inserting a "blank" character in each zone (up to number needed) and setting display property to invisible? 1 in hero; 1 in opp, 4 in enemy and graveyard?s
